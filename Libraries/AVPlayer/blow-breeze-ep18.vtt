-(Episode 18) -Mister, please make a u-turn. Hurry!

00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:21.695
I don't want to ever come to this pathetic house

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.859
again, so you better get away from my son.

00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:29.875
Goodness! How dare you bewitch my kind grandson?

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:31.367
Let's go, mom.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:33.765
Awful wench.

00:01:36.086 --> 00:01:37.086
Shin-ae!

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.703
Shin-ae!

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.101
What happened? Who did this to your face?

00:01:57.188 --> 00:01:58.454
Did my mom do this?

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.250
Answer me.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.112
I don't want to show this side of me to you.

00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:11.827
Please just go.

00:02:11.852 --> 00:02:13.980
Answer me! Who did this to you?

00:02:16.508 --> 00:02:18.359
Shin-ae? Shin-ae!

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:55.292
You're okay now.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.173
Don't worry about anything.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.631
Hey, Mi-poong works in the marketing department.

00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:22.733
I'll take care of her from now on, so don't you worry about anything.

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:35.227
Bang Sung-sik.

00:03:37.774 --> 00:03:40.378
It isn't a coincidence that he became Mi-poong's director.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.820
I dare him to touch one hair on her.

00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:46.880
I won't forgive him.

00:03:58.063 --> 00:04:02.244
Mi-poong, what did the director say? Why did he want to meet you separately?

00:04:04.415 --> 00:04:08.867
Mi-poong, do you know the director personally?

00:04:09.493 --> 00:04:12.000
No, that's not it.

00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:15.821
He's the friend of someone I know, and I met him coincidentally.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.740
He found out that I worked here and just called me

00:04:18.765 --> 00:04:20.983
over to say hi. He didn't say anything important.

00:04:21.352 --> 00:04:22.437
That's all?

00:04:22.617 --> 00:04:24.812
Yes, that's all! Really!

00:04:24.837 --> 00:04:26.464
Hello, everyone!

00:04:26.489 --> 00:04:29.648
I'm Bang Sung-sik, the new marketing director of Winner's Group.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.199
Hello. I'm Kim Bo-young, the section chief of the third marketing team.

00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:38.498
Yes, I know very well of your great reputation.

00:04:38.523 --> 00:04:41.046
Winner's Group couldn't go on without you.

00:04:41.672 --> 00:04:42.891
I'm flattered.

00:04:43.602 --> 00:04:48.539
Wow. You're very modest, too. I look forward to working with you.

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:50.415
Me, too.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.211
In that sense, I would like to buy all of you dinner.

00:04:56.236 --> 00:04:58.571
Are all of you free?

00:04:58.596 --> 00:05:00.820
-Yes! -We'd love that!

00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:03.422
Wow, Ms. Kim.

00:05:03.618 --> 00:05:07.852
The third marketing team is very alive! Just look at their eyes! They're very excited!

00:05:08.047 --> 00:05:11.260
I'll be seeing all of you later, all right?

00:05:11.285 --> 00:05:13.406
-Yes, we'll definitely come! -Of course!

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:16.415
We'll sing and dance, too!

00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:22.445
-Go ahead and keep working. -All right.

00:05:24.382 --> 00:05:25.382
Let's work.

00:05:38.977 --> 00:05:39.977
Ms. Kim...

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.719
What is it, Mi-poong? Do you have something to tell me?

00:05:44.672 --> 00:05:48.266
I'm sorry, but can I miss out on tonight's company dinner?

00:05:48.665 --> 00:05:50.535
Why? Is there an emergency at home?

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.916
There's no emergency, but...

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.180
If it's not an emergency, make sure you participate.

00:05:58.205 --> 00:06:00.001
Company dinners are an extension of work.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.844
On top of that, the director arranged this

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:03.813
special dinner to cheer on our marketing team.

00:06:04.367 --> 00:06:07.703
What if you weren't there? He'll doubt our teamwork.

00:06:09.571 --> 00:06:11.588
Yes, I understand, Ms. Kim.

00:06:12.211 --> 00:06:13.752
Then you're coming with us, okay?

00:06:18.172 --> 00:06:20.763
Out of all people, why did he have to become the director?

00:06:24.172 --> 00:06:27.922
-Where are we going? -I'll take care of that. You just have to have fun.

00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:29.360
Don't worry about that.

00:06:33.188 --> 00:06:34.570
Hey, Ha-yeon.

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:37.306
You must be going to a company dinner.

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:42.176
Yes, to cheer on the third marketing team.

00:06:42.946 --> 00:06:43.976
What about you guys?

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:45.899
Us, too.

00:06:47.733 --> 00:06:48.733
Not a date?

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.131
Think however you like.

00:06:57.968 --> 00:07:02.368
All right then. You two have fun on your date. Let's go, everyone.

00:07:02.393 --> 00:07:03.393
-Yes. -Yes.

00:07:32.265 --> 00:07:35.022
Cheers to the third marketing team!

00:07:35.047 --> 00:07:36.452
-Cheers! -Cheers!

00:07:45.007 --> 00:07:46.007
Sit down.

00:07:58.265 --> 00:08:00.398
Mr. Bang, you should say something.

00:08:00.812 --> 00:08:03.092
Oh, me? May I?

00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:15.647
All of you will know very well who I am.

00:08:16.093 --> 00:08:18.420
The eldest son of Winner Group's president Bang Soon-Nam.

00:08:18.445 --> 00:08:20.543
Winner Group's heir!

00:08:23.293 --> 00:08:26.876
But I am not a hard person at all!

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.748
I know how to say sorry when I make mistakes!

00:08:31.183 --> 00:08:34.863
Once our paths cross, I will go with you until the end!

00:08:35.293 --> 00:08:39.339
Bang Sung-sik!

00:08:39.364 --> 00:08:40.364
Now, now.

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:48.081
If you keep helping me out, I will never forget you!

00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:53.872
In that sense, I will sing a song.

00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:09.250
"Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."

00:09:09.275 --> 00:09:14.783
"I, I, I first for you, for you, for you I fell, fell, fell, fallen baby."

00:09:14.808 --> 00:09:18.647
"Shawty, shawty, shawty, shawty. Eyes are blinding, blinding, blinding.

00:09:18.672 --> 00:09:22.191
Breath is stifled, stifled, stifled. I'm going crazy, crazy baby."

00:09:22.216 --> 00:09:25.209
"Inside the gaze, inside the gaze that stares back at me.

00:09:25.233 --> 00:09:28.121
It's as if I'm, as if I'm a guy bewitched by something."

00:09:28.146 --> 00:09:29.613
"I can't even escape it now."

00:09:29.638 --> 00:09:32.878
-"The way you look, the way you look when you

00:09:32.903 --> 00:09:36.995
walk over." -Ms. Kim, I'm going to the restroom!

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.782
"Wherever you go, you confidently smile, your attractiveness. So much

00:09:40.807 --> 00:09:44.356
that people can't change their mind about it. I've fallen for you."

00:09:44.381 --> 00:09:47.379
"Sorry sorry sorry sorry. Eyes are blinding, blinding, blinding..."

00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:58.050
I'm at a place where you drink and sing songs.

00:09:59.285 --> 00:10:01.086
I'll come home as soon as this is over.

00:10:02.863 --> 00:10:05.196
Come on, mom. I'm not a little kid.

00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:10.467
Okay. I'll be careful, so don't worry.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.340
Hey, Mi-poong.

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:34.499
Did you go to the restroom?

00:10:35.441 --> 00:10:36.441
Yes.

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:41.980
That was a song I sang for you as a means of apology.

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:45.848
You left without listening to the whole thing, so I was upset.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.730
Pardon?

00:10:48.386 --> 00:10:53.602
You'll come to realize that I'm different from two-faced people.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.131
They must be waiting for us.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.156
Just one more thing.

00:10:58.936 --> 00:11:01.459
We'll have to keep seeing each other at work from now on.

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.780
What would other people think if you were wary and awkward with me?

00:11:07.085 --> 00:11:09.889
It won't be easy, but let's forget about what happened last time.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:11.949
I'll make an effort.

00:11:12.475 --> 00:11:14.085
I hope you will, too.

00:11:14.577 --> 00:11:15.577
How about it?

00:11:17.515 --> 00:11:23.030
I'll show you my sincerity through actions rather than words.

00:11:24.077 --> 00:11:25.077
Okay?

00:11:26.249 --> 00:11:27.449
What do you think?

00:11:28.405 --> 00:11:29.834
I'll go in now.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:41.890
She's natural.

00:11:42.686 --> 00:11:43.686
Natural.

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:50.004
I like natural things like sea squirts, sea cucumbers, rock-fish, and abalones.

00:12:07.155 --> 00:12:08.155
Jang-go.

00:12:09.257 --> 00:12:10.257
Huh?

00:12:10.282 --> 00:12:11.819
Are you waiting for a call?

00:12:14.944 --> 00:12:15.944
No.

00:12:23.882 --> 00:12:25.246
The pasta is good, right?

00:12:26.616 --> 00:12:28.483
Yeah, it is.

00:12:29.522 --> 00:12:30.959
Let's have some wine, too.

00:12:34.015 --> 00:12:35.082
Let's not drink.

00:12:37.116 --> 00:12:39.170
Oh. Okay.

00:12:44.795 --> 00:12:46.779
Um, Ha-yeon...

00:12:48.249 --> 00:12:50.727
About the mistake I made last time when I was drunk...

00:12:52.116 --> 00:12:53.445
Did I really do that?

00:12:54.163 --> 00:12:57.536
I don't remember. I can't believe I did something like that.

00:12:59.077 --> 00:13:03.007
Then are you saying that I lied?

00:13:04.038 --> 00:13:05.444
That's not it.

00:13:06.184 --> 00:13:09.440
I'm not trying to make an excuse. I really can't remember.

00:13:12.344 --> 00:13:18.296
Is it because you feel burdened to buy me dinner and drinks to make up for kissing me?

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:20.577
No, it's not like that.

00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:25.687
You keep spacing out.

00:13:27.219 --> 00:13:31.780
It's no fun eating with a man who doesn't pay attention to me.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.773
Wait, Hee-dong...

00:14:23.422 --> 00:14:24.422
It's fine.

00:14:25.859 --> 00:14:26.926
You have me now.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.843
So just trust me and stay by my side.

00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:34.101
Got it?

00:14:48.344 --> 00:14:49.344
Father.

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:51.679
Grandfather.

00:14:54.804 --> 00:14:55.804
Hee-dong.

00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:57.226
Who...?

00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:00.695
She's my girlfriend.

00:15:03.914 --> 00:15:07.257
Your girlfriend?

00:15:11.758 --> 00:15:15.318
So this old man is the owner of that 100 million dollar inheritance.

00:15:19.148 --> 00:15:20.948
I'm going to marry Shin-ae.

00:15:34.758 --> 00:15:37.616
Grandfather, father, and mom...

00:15:38.609 --> 00:15:40.071
please give us permission.

00:15:40.096 --> 00:15:44.234
Jo Hee-dong! I told you that you can't get married to her!

00:15:46.969 --> 00:15:47.969
Honey.

00:15:49.273 --> 00:15:54.123
Hee-dong, I already talked to you, so what are you doing?

00:15:55.211 --> 00:16:00.359
You! How can you disrespect my words and go along with this nonsense?

00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:04.179
I can't allow this to happen! I will never give you permission!

00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:06.179
Mother.

00:16:07.312 --> 00:16:10.038
Would I oppose for no reason?

00:16:10.156 --> 00:16:16.539
She's an orphan! She didn't go to college either!

00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:21.853
There's a limit to everything! I'm not opposing for no reason at all!

00:16:22.351 --> 00:16:24.404
Is that why you made her face this way?

00:16:24.976 --> 00:16:26.744
Because she's an orphan?

00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:30.601
Did you make her face this way because she only graduated high school?

00:16:34.797 --> 00:16:35.797
Oh my goodness.

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:51.969
Hey...

00:16:53.476 --> 00:16:55.452
I didn't do that!

00:16:55.844 --> 00:16:57.015
You didn't?

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:02.030
I know everything you did with grandmother at her house. I saw everything.

00:17:02.242 --> 00:17:06.103
No, no, no. That's not it. Chung-ja and I were

00:17:06.128 --> 00:17:10.234
angry, so we did go to her house and break things,

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:13.265
but we never laid a hand on her. We're telling the truth.

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:24.746
Chung-ja did grab her hair, but she didn't hit her. I'm serious.

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:35.574
I'm sorry. I'll apologize on her behalf.

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:38.039
No.

00:17:38.906 --> 00:17:40.726
I'm sorry, mother.

00:17:41.289 --> 00:17:44.163
I'm sorry I'm such a lacking person.

00:17:45.031 --> 00:17:47.991
Father, I'm sorry. Grandfather, I'm sorry.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.420
I'm going to leave home.

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:07.968
I'll come back when you give us permission.

00:18:08.179 --> 00:18:10.231
-Let's go, Shin-ae. -Hee-dong.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:15.663
Hee-dong, no! Honey, why are you just sitting there? Hee-dong!

00:18:15.688 --> 00:18:22.705
-He's leaving with that witch! Do something and stop him! -Chung-ja, you!

00:18:24.484 --> 00:18:29.374
Aren't you being too harsh?

00:18:30.758 --> 00:18:31.758
Pardon?

00:18:31.783 --> 00:18:36.167
There's no one in this world who wants to be an orphan.

00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:42.123
No one lives a poor life because they want to!

00:18:43.867 --> 00:18:45.609
Father!

00:18:46.945 --> 00:18:50.890
If she has a terrible personality, there's nothing we can do about it.

00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:57.155
But must you be so spiteful about her being an orphan who has nothing?

00:18:58.148 --> 00:18:59.359
If you're an adult...

00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:01.555
If you're really a parent...

00:19:02.344 --> 00:19:06.194
you should be kind to her for your child's sake.

00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:13.897
I don't mind if my son brings a poor woman as his wife.

00:19:15.538 --> 00:19:19.802
I just wish I had such a child. I would have no other wish then.

00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:31.386
We need to talk.

00:19:40.086 --> 00:19:44.996
What do we do? What if I get kicked out? What do I do?

00:19:48.515 --> 00:19:51.249
Are you a gangster? Why would you hit someone?

00:19:51.828 --> 00:19:54.368
I really didn't lay a hand on her face!

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.835
Honey, please believe me.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.788
Do you think that makes sense?

00:20:02.211 --> 00:20:06.788
You broke her things and grabbed her hair, but you didn't lay a hand on her face?

00:20:07.398 --> 00:20:10.374
Then who made her face like that?

00:20:11.594 --> 00:20:13.061
How would I know that?

00:20:13.851 --> 00:20:15.687
I really didn't do that.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.835
She was kind enough to let it go!

00:20:18.295 --> 00:20:20.624
You have no excuses even if you go to jail for assault!

00:20:21.203 --> 00:20:24.140
How can you make a woman's face Ike that?

00:20:25.469 --> 00:20:26.845
I really didn't do that.

00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:28.601
Enough!

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:30.961
Get them married!

00:20:34.258 --> 00:20:36.554
This is ridiculous!

00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:41.288
What do I do? Who on earth did this?

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:48.312
Hey!

00:20:48.969 --> 00:20:51.570
What did Dal-ho say? Is he very angry?

00:20:52.101 --> 00:20:55.726
Dal-ho said to get Hee-dong married.

00:20:55.751 --> 00:21:00.288
Why did you hit her like that?

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:04.211
You just had to hit her on the face out of all places. Everyone can see it now.

00:21:04.578 --> 00:21:06.324
Mom, I really didn't do that!

00:21:06.476 --> 00:21:08.693
You were with me, too!

00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:13.016
I did grab her hair, but I didn't lay a hand on her face!

00:21:15.414 --> 00:21:17.402
Did you do that to her?

00:21:17.844 --> 00:21:19.640
Oh my goodness!

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:24.570
Why are you blaming me? All I did was break her things!

00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:27.093
I don't know! What do I do now?

00:21:27.913 --> 00:21:33.561
Because of her face, you and I ended up as ignorant bullies,

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:38.117
and she gets to marry Hee-dong with pity points from father and Dal-ho.

00:21:38.476 --> 00:21:39.743
Mom, what can I do?

00:21:41.086 --> 00:21:43.100
So are you going to get them married?

00:21:44.031 --> 00:21:46.882
Are you crazy? I'd rather die!

00:21:48.296 --> 00:21:49.757
Oh my goodness.

00:21:50.437 --> 00:21:53.015
What on earth is going on?

00:22:08.008 --> 00:22:09.274
She's not home yet?

00:22:27.226 --> 00:22:29.367
(Little Tadpole)

00:22:31.148 --> 00:22:34.038
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable.

00:22:34.063 --> 00:22:35.343
Why isn't she picking up?

00:22:35.858 --> 00:22:37.187
Hurry up!

00:22:40.624 --> 00:22:43.424
-Mr. Bang, we had a good time. Thank you.

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:47.515
Mr. Kim, you'll take us out often like this, right?

00:22:47.945 --> 00:22:49.288
Of course.

00:22:49.859 --> 00:22:54.843
So the last course is...taking all of you safely home.

00:22:55.445 --> 00:22:56.445
Get in.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.376
Really? Thank you, sir! Yes!

00:22:59.401 --> 00:23:00.735
Excuse me.

00:23:01.664 --> 00:23:03.187
Mi-poong, get in.

00:23:03.937 --> 00:23:06.461
No, it's okay. I'm going to meet someone.

00:23:06.734 --> 00:23:08.867
Who would you meet at this hour?

00:23:09.148 --> 00:23:10.579
Just get in.

00:23:11.008 --> 00:23:13.547
I'm fine. I'll be going now.

00:23:14.094 --> 00:23:16.752
See you tomorrow, everyone. See you tomorrow, Ms. Kim.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.974
Okay then. See you tomorrow.

00:23:32.265 --> 00:23:33.465
Hey, Kim Mi-poong!

00:23:33.937 --> 00:23:36.487
What happened? Why didn't you pick up your phone? Didn't you

00:23:36.512 --> 00:23:39.062
see my message? Do you know how much I was worried about you?

00:23:41.328 --> 00:23:42.328
What's wrong?

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.117
Something happened, huh?

00:23:44.578 --> 00:23:46.210
Did Sung-sik do something to you?

00:23:47.523 --> 00:23:48.656
Nothing happened.

00:23:49.758 --> 00:23:52.390
Really? Are you sure nothing happened?

00:23:53.054 --> 00:23:55.187
Do you want something to happen?

00:23:55.344 --> 00:23:56.811
Why are you panicking?

00:23:57.874 --> 00:23:59.594
Of course I would be!

00:24:01.812 --> 00:24:04.145
Anyways, I'm glad nothing happened.

00:24:05.398 --> 00:24:07.495
If Sung-sik tries something funny on you or

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.759
bothers you again, let me know. I'll scold him.

00:24:12.234 --> 00:24:14.567
I'm more bothered by your behavior.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.390
What?

00:24:16.531 --> 00:24:17.531
I'm bothersome?

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:20.109
Yes. Mind your own business.

00:24:21.008 --> 00:24:24.141
If he bothers me, I'll take care of him myself.

00:24:32.351 --> 00:24:33.905
She hates it when I worry about her.

00:24:34.594 --> 00:24:37.717
How can she say those things when I've been waiting for her all this time?

00:24:39.094 --> 00:24:40.806
Fine! Fine! You're on your own now!

00:24:56.031 --> 00:25:00.881
Mr. Kim and Dal-ho didn't even glance at the breakfast you made and just left.

00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:05.299
The green vegetable juice you had made for Mr. Kim is still in his room, too.

00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:08.679
Really?

00:25:08.704 --> 00:25:14.739
I think he lost all interest in you after seeing that woman's face last night.

00:25:15.297 --> 00:25:17.906
Mom, she's a fox.

00:25:18.664 --> 00:25:20.773
She's a fox with nine tails.

00:25:21.609 --> 00:25:23.768
How can she make me like this overnight?

00:25:23.984 --> 00:25:28.287
That's why the more you try to oppose them, the more of an outcast you'll be.

00:25:29.148 --> 00:25:30.741
Surrender, okay?

00:25:32.023 --> 00:25:36.656
And if I do? You want me to accept that fox as my daughter-in-law?

00:25:36.681 --> 00:25:38.131
If not, what will you do?

00:25:38.765 --> 00:25:41.560
If you don't give them permission, Hee-dong is bound

00:25:41.586 --> 00:25:44.169
to cut off ties with you and never come back home.

00:25:44.461 --> 00:25:45.461
What do I do?

00:25:47.211 --> 00:25:48.945
I want to die.

00:25:49.586 --> 00:25:50.586
But Chung-ja...

00:25:51.976 --> 00:25:55.398
after thinking carefully about this all night,

00:25:56.382 --> 00:26:01.804
I don't think this she is so horrible after all.

00:26:02.351 --> 00:26:05.880
She's pathetic. How is she not horrible?

00:26:06.211 --> 00:26:13.210
Yes! Later on, Mr. Kim's 100-million-dollar inheritance will belong to Hee-dong!

00:26:13.883 --> 00:26:19.734
What if Hee-dong had in-laws who cling onto him for money?

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:26.054
Then obviously, Hee-dong and all that money will go to his in-laws.

00:26:26.523 --> 00:26:30.246
But she's an orphan!

00:26:31.109 --> 00:26:34.223
She's an orphan you don't have to share anything with!

00:27:01.804 --> 00:27:03.187
Hee-dong, what are you doing?

00:27:03.212 --> 00:27:04.212
Oh, hold on!

00:27:05.398 --> 00:27:06.601
Don't move!

00:27:19.508 --> 00:27:20.712
This is your breakfast.

00:27:24.078 --> 00:27:25.078
Thank you.

00:27:25.336 --> 00:27:28.529
It's French toast. I looked up the recipe online. Hurry up and try it.

00:27:31.187 --> 00:27:32.650
I think it'll be delicious.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.773
Who is it?

00:27:52.242 --> 00:27:54.787
-Who is it? -Hee-dong, it's me.

00:27:54.812 --> 00:27:55.812
Mom!

00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:58.585
I came, too!

00:27:59.866 --> 00:28:01.460
Hold on! Grandma!

00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:10.671
Please get out so she can wear her clothes. Please! Get out!

00:28:10.696 --> 00:28:13.601
-All right. -Okay.

00:28:13.627 --> 00:28:14.627
Hurry!

00:28:20.383 --> 00:28:22.187
Mom, did you see Hee-dong?

00:28:24.679 --> 00:28:27.819
Of course I did. I have eyes, too.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.939
Mom, Hee-dong never even made ramen before. I raised him that way!

00:28:32.468 --> 00:28:37.010
But how dare that pathetic girl act like she's some sort of princess! She's

00:28:37.035 --> 00:28:41.396
in bed getting breakfast while he's wearing an apron and cooking for her!

00:28:42.531 --> 00:28:44.288
Do I still have to put up with this?

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:48.142
If you don't want to cut ties with Hee-dong, you must put up with

00:28:48.167 --> 00:28:51.128
it. We came all the way here. Are you going to ruin everything?

00:28:55.476 --> 00:28:56.476
You can come in now.

00:28:58.156 --> 00:28:59.985
All right.

00:29:12.859 --> 00:29:15.151
Um, hi.

00:29:15.609 --> 00:29:18.702
Good morning! Did we come too early?

00:29:20.858 --> 00:29:22.396
Hello.

00:29:28.781 --> 00:29:32.602
Hold it in. Are you going to mess this up?

00:29:40.703 --> 00:29:43.234
Didn't you come here because you had something to say?

00:29:43.351 --> 00:29:48.774
Yes, we did, but your mom must not be able to say anything.

00:29:49.828 --> 00:29:52.765
Just hurry up and say it.

00:29:54.984 --> 00:29:58.195
Hee-dong, let me ask you one thing.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:29:59.890
Go ahead.

00:30:01.648 --> 00:30:09.157
If I don't give you permission to marry her, will you really...

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:15.171
not come home and cut off ties with me?

00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:18.351
Yes.

00:30:19.445 --> 00:30:22.709
I'm almost thirty years old. I should live my own life now.

00:30:23.742 --> 00:30:25.573
Until now, I lived with you...

00:30:27.578 --> 00:30:31.245
but I'm going to live the rest of my life with Shin-ae.

00:30:31.984 --> 00:30:34.172
Fine. Fine.

00:30:35.515 --> 00:30:38.007
Get married. Get married.

00:30:41.625 --> 00:30:42.625
Really?

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.856
Are you giving us permission to get married?

00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:50.702
Yes, I am, so come home!

00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:56.241
Your grandfather and father gave you permission, too, so stop upsetting your mom!

00:30:57.359 --> 00:30:59.720
Thank you, mother and grandmother.

00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:02.390
Hold on, mom.

00:31:05.359 --> 00:31:08.896
When Shin-ae and I get married, we'll all be living under the same roof now, so I

00:31:08.921 --> 00:31:12.294
don't think there should be any hard feelings between you us.

00:31:13.828 --> 00:31:17.492
Grandmother and mother, while you're giving us permission to get

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.954
married, please apologize to Shin-ae for your behaviors, too.

00:31:22.765 --> 00:31:24.226
What did you say?

00:31:24.969 --> 00:31:27.695
If you apologize, I'll come home.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.734
Stop it. I'm fine, Hee-dong. No, I'm fine.

00:31:35.914 --> 00:31:36.914
Mom.

00:31:38.609 --> 00:31:39.609
Fine.

00:31:40.304 --> 00:31:41.304
You jerk.

00:31:47.609 --> 00:31:49.605
I'm sorry. Sorry.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.220
I'm sorry. Happy now?

00:31:56.437 --> 00:31:58.640
I'm sorry, too. Happy now?

00:32:00.554 --> 00:32:01.554
Jerk!

00:32:01.812 --> 00:32:02.812
Chung-ja!

00:32:04.976 --> 00:32:05.976
Jerk!

00:32:06.828 --> 00:32:10.716
He's a jerk! A jerk!

00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:14.109
You jerk!

00:32:22.363 --> 00:32:23.816
Hello? This is Kim Bo-young.

00:32:25.731 --> 00:32:27.628
Why is the personnel team calling me?

00:32:29.661 --> 00:32:31.738
What? Kim Mi-poong?

00:32:33.864 --> 00:32:34.864
All right.

00:32:35.926 --> 00:32:36.926
I'll do that.

00:32:42.684 --> 00:32:44.151
Ms. Kim, what's wrong?

00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:47.684
Ms. Kim Mi-poong?

00:32:48.161 --> 00:32:49.161
Yes, Ms. Kim?

00:32:50.622 --> 00:32:53.829
Starting from today, you'll be the director's secretary.

00:32:54.544 --> 00:32:56.356
Pardon? Me?

00:32:58.169 --> 00:33:04.269
Why am I becoming his secretary? Did I do something wrong?

00:33:04.989 --> 00:33:08.873
Are you pretending not to know about this?

00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:12.201
No! I really didn't know about this!

00:33:13.895 --> 00:33:14.895
Hello.

00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:19.809
The personnel team called you, right?

00:33:19.834 --> 00:33:21.475
Yes, just now.

00:33:22.169 --> 00:33:24.441
I'm sorry. I should have asked for permission from you

00:33:24.466 --> 00:33:26.878
and the members of the third marketing team beforehand.

00:33:26.903 --> 00:33:29.460
I had to go through the process, so I was late.

00:33:32.294 --> 00:33:37.168
I'm trying to understand my job better, so I need some helping hands.

00:33:37.193 --> 00:33:39.901
That's why I would like Mi-poong to work as my secretary for

00:33:39.926 --> 00:33:42.500
the time being. All of you are okay with that, aren't you?

00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:47.684
This is all for Winner's Group.

00:33:48.551 --> 00:33:50.004
Well, we have no choice.

00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:51.231
Thank you.

00:33:51.848 --> 00:33:54.796
Mi-poong, what are you doing? Hurry up and move your things.

00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:56.141
Have a good day.

00:34:00.856 --> 00:34:03.348
Mi-poong, follow Mr. Bang's order.

00:34:05.317 --> 00:34:07.137
Okay.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.645
Yes, come in.

00:34:23.887 --> 00:34:26.137
Oh, hi. What is it?

00:34:27.442 --> 00:34:29.473
Well, Mr. Bang...

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:34.356
can't you send me back to the marketing team?

00:34:35.262 --> 00:34:37.723
I've never been a secretary before...

00:34:37.902 --> 00:34:41.123
and it hasn't been long since I started working

00:34:41.148 --> 00:34:44.569
here, so I don't think I'll be of much help to you.

00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:46.341
Ms. Kim Mi-poong,

00:34:47.614 --> 00:34:50.067
do you think work is some kind of playground?

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:54.614
I did this because I had a plan for it. Do you think I'm foolish?

00:34:54.864 --> 00:34:58.336
-No, that's not it... -I'll be the one to judge if you'll be helpful or not.

00:35:00.254 --> 00:35:04.038
You must not know because you lack social life, but you can't

00:35:04.063 --> 00:35:07.479
maneuver your work life in the direction you want to go.

00:35:08.434 --> 00:35:10.785
And the secretary's office is the core of our

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.262
company. You'll be working on very important tasks.

00:35:16.434 --> 00:35:19.934
Take responsibility and focus on your work.

00:35:22.262 --> 00:35:24.402
Okay, I understand.

00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:27.458
You may leave.

00:35:39.754 --> 00:35:44.160
Charisma! Amazing! How can she not fall for me?

00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:49.106
Follow me.

00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:51.057
Pardon? To where?

00:35:53.098 --> 00:35:58.316
Just follow me. From now on, you and I are a needle and a thread!

00:36:14.403 --> 00:36:17.789
Jang-go went into a big law firm. He should buy a new suit.

00:36:18.989 --> 00:36:21.652
He only wears these two suits all year long.

00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:23.333
This won't do.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:26.853
I need to meet him at lunch and go shop with him for a new suit.

00:36:33.028 --> 00:36:34.028
Hi, Ha-yeon.

00:36:34.488 --> 00:36:36.262
Ms. Hwang, do you have time today?

00:36:36.848 --> 00:36:38.781
Let's eat lunch with Jang-go.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:43.185
How did you read my mind and call at the right time?

00:36:43.747 --> 00:36:48.314
I was just about to meet up with him for lunch and go shop for his new suit.

00:36:49.598 --> 00:36:50.598
Really?

00:36:50.981 --> 00:36:54.101
Then let's eat lunch and then go shop for his suit together.

00:36:55.075 --> 00:36:57.408
Okay! I'll get ready and come over!

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.324
Wow! This looks nice!

00:37:09.754 --> 00:37:11.535
This one looks nice!

00:37:12.512 --> 00:37:16.150
Mr. Bang, I don't need these clothes.

00:37:16.497 --> 00:37:18.237
Come on, Mi-poong.

00:37:18.747 --> 00:37:21.783
We didn't come here to shop for your clothes. We came

00:37:21.808 --> 00:37:24.730
here to shop for clothes for the secretary's office.

00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:27.695
The secretary's office is like the face of the company.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.747
If you look grubby, then what would I look like?

00:37:30.772 --> 00:37:35.065
And this will all be paid for by the company card, so don't feel burdened.

00:37:35.091 --> 00:37:38.246
Then I'll make sure to dress nicely.

00:37:39.167 --> 00:37:42.589
I told you. I'm not buying you clothes because I like you.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.735
We came here to buy the company's uniform.

00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:48.025
Haven't you heard the saying: "fashion is strategy, too?"

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:53.017
Your fate and the company's face can change depending on what clothes you wear.

00:37:53.245 --> 00:37:56.952
I'll teach you all about marketing, so don't

00:37:56.977 --> 00:38:00.600
feel burdened. Pretend we're studying, okay?

00:38:05.308 --> 00:38:09.596
Wow! This is perfect!

00:38:10.839 --> 00:38:14.924
What are you doing? Go try it on in the fitting room.

00:38:16.745 --> 00:38:17.745
Hurry! Hurry1

00:38:19.775 --> 00:38:21.175
Where is the fitting room?

00:38:23.151 --> 00:38:26.831
We can buy his suit first and then eat lunch here. What do you think?

00:38:27.214 --> 00:38:29.145
That sounds great. You have time, right?

00:38:29.574 --> 00:38:31.376
I told you I don't need to buy a suit.

00:38:31.652 --> 00:38:35.263
I want to buy you a suit.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.354
Okay. Then let's go buy something for you first.

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.209
No, I'm fine!

00:39:03.863 --> 00:39:05.996
My Mi-poong is really all natural.

00:39:06.824 --> 00:39:07.824
Excuse me?

00:39:12.222 --> 00:39:16.129
What I meant is that...you look very nice.

00:39:16.597 --> 00:39:19.664
You deserve to work in the secretary's office!

00:39:25.886 --> 00:39:26.886
Who's this?

00:39:32.128 --> 00:39:33.128
Sung-sik?

00:39:35.472 --> 00:39:36.604
Hey, Ha-yeon.

00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:41.762
Hey, Lee Jang-go.

00:39:43.824 --> 00:39:48.357
Oh, my. This man must be the one who gave her the bouquet last time.

00:39:49.214 --> 00:39:50.806
But who...?

00:39:51.808 --> 00:39:53.003
She's Jang-go's mother.

00:39:53.028 --> 00:39:58.870
I see. Hello, ma'am. I'm Jang-go's college friend Bang Sung-sik.

00:39:59.667 --> 00:40:00.932
I see.

00:40:01.253 --> 00:40:03.652
But what are the three of you doing here?

00:40:04.245 --> 00:40:07.124
We came to find a suit for Jang-go.

00:40:11.824 --> 00:40:15.065
Kim Mi-poong, what are you doing here with this punk?

00:40:15.878 --> 00:40:17.784
No, I just...

00:40:18.659 --> 00:40:21.073
How can you call me "punk" when your mother is here?

00:40:21.099 --> 00:40:23.619
-Jang-go... -Jang-go.

00:40:23.644 --> 00:40:25.354
I asked you what you were doing here!

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:30.151
What are you doing?

00:40:31.542 --> 00:40:33.009
Jang-go, what's wrong?

00:40:34.495 --> 00:40:36.050
-Jang-go! -Jang-go!

00:40:36.075 --> 00:40:37.542
-Bye. -Jang-go.

00:40:40.049 --> 00:40:42.831
My gosh. He's really ridiculous.

00:40:45.706 --> 00:40:50.569
So he bought her the bouquet last time, and he's buying her clothes today.

00:40:51.831 --> 00:40:53.859
So it was him.

00:40:54.027 --> 00:40:57.749
But Ha-yeon told me he's the son of Winner's Group's president.

00:40:58.511 --> 00:41:01.977
Goodness. Mi-poong is so skillful.

00:41:02.002 --> 00:41:03.955
How did she manage to seduce such a guy?

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:09.076
That family would never allow their son to marry a North Korean girl.

00:41:10.527 --> 00:41:11.752
What do you call this?

00:41:12.018 --> 00:41:14.399
Leeching off a wealthy man?

00:41:14.753 --> 00:41:15.753
My goodness.

00:41:16.488 --> 00:41:19.739
-Oh! You call that a sponsor, right? A sponsor! -Mom!

00:41:20.441 --> 00:41:21.441
Oh, my.

00:41:25.402 --> 00:41:26.402
Oh!

00:41:50.644 --> 00:41:52.890
Jang-go! Jang-go, what's wrong?

00:41:53.581 --> 00:41:54.581
Let go!

00:41:55.214 --> 00:41:56.547
I said let go of me!

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:06.489
What are you doing?

00:42:07.769 --> 00:42:09.268
What about you? What's all this?

00:42:10.074 --> 00:42:11.074
Are you crazy?

00:42:11.644 --> 00:42:13.562
Why would you accept these from him?

00:42:14.566 --> 00:42:16.721
Are you a bum? Do you have no pride?

00:42:18.175 --> 00:42:20.133
These shoes and clothes mean nothing.

00:42:21.706 --> 00:42:22.706
So?

00:42:23.644 --> 00:42:25.526
Are you going to date him?

00:42:26.902 --> 00:42:31.324
Why does it matter to you what I receive and who I meet?

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.871
Why should you care?

00:42:36.761 --> 00:42:37.761
What?

00:42:41.745 --> 00:42:42.945
Why should I care?

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.620
Fine.

00:42:56.034 --> 00:42:57.706
You're telling me not to care, right?

00:43:00.574 --> 00:43:01.574
Fine.

00:43:02.573 --> 00:43:03.818
From now on...

00:43:06.011 --> 00:43:07.307
I...

00:43:09.534 --> 00:43:11.159
won't be your friend anymore.

00:43:13.034 --> 00:43:17.534
I won't care who you meet and what you do.

00:43:21.855 --> 00:43:22.855
Happy now?

00:43:27.902 --> 00:43:29.502
Sorry for bothering you.

00:43:52.917 --> 00:43:53.917
Jang-go!

00:43:53.942 --> 00:43:56.440
-Mi-poong! -Jang-go!

00:45:20.542 --> 00:45:24.430
What do you call this? Leeching off a wealthy man?

00:45:24.777 --> 00:45:26.341
My goodness.

00:45:26.628 --> 00:45:30.162
-Oh! You call that a sponsor, right? A sponsor! -Mom!

00:45:33.526 --> 00:45:37.994
I admit my words were a bit harsh, but there was no reason for him to get so angry!

00:45:38.901 --> 00:45:40.968
He never did that to me before.

00:45:42.738 --> 00:45:45.221
Does he like Mi-poong?

00:45:46.222 --> 00:45:47.495
No way.

00:45:48.183 --> 00:45:51.255
It seemed like things were working out well between Ha-yeon and him.

00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:57.003
Mom.

00:45:58.449 --> 00:45:59.722
I'm sorry about yesterday.

00:46:00.628 --> 00:46:03.729
No, my words were harsh.

00:46:03.956 --> 00:46:06.077
I shouldn't have said such things about her.

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:08.464
I'll be careful from now on.

00:46:09.074 --> 00:46:10.074
I'm going now.

00:46:10.099 --> 00:46:11.873
-Aren't you going to eat breakfast? -No.

00:46:13.519 --> 00:46:14.519
Gosh.

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:21.618
What's this? Because of one girl, we fought and we're drifting apart.

00:46:22.347 --> 00:46:23.347
Goodness!

00:46:28.003 --> 00:46:31.628
Wow! Your company bought all of this for you.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:34.230
Yes.

00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:38.513
It hasn't been long since you started working there, and yet, you're

00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:41.757
getting acknowledged and being promoted to becoming a secretary.

00:46:41.782 --> 00:46:43.917
I'm so proud of you!

00:46:45.222 --> 00:46:46.822
Mom, are you that happy?

00:46:47.261 --> 00:46:50.126
Of course. Even in North Korea, secretary positions are

00:46:50.151 --> 00:46:53.066
only given to those who are the most trusted and skilled.

00:46:53.402 --> 00:46:55.460
Not anyone can be a secretary.

00:46:58.074 --> 00:46:59.074
Why?

00:46:59.269 --> 00:47:02.634
You don't like being a secretary?

00:47:03.167 --> 00:47:04.500
Mom, the truth is...

00:47:05.472 --> 00:47:08.964
you know Bang Sung-sik, the man who brought a bouquet to our house?

00:47:09.394 --> 00:47:10.394
Yes.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.610
He's my company's director.

00:47:13.488 --> 00:47:14.688
I'm his secretary.

00:47:16.152 --> 00:47:17.152
What?

00:47:44.074 --> 00:47:45.074
Hello.

00:47:47.324 --> 00:47:49.979
How many customers came today?

00:47:50.917 --> 00:47:53.823
About ten?

00:47:54.222 --> 00:47:56.909
Ten is ten. Eleven is eleven.

00:47:57.253 --> 00:47:58.542
What's so vague about that?

00:47:59.175 --> 00:48:00.175
Pardon?

00:48:00.613 --> 00:48:04.008
Is it ten people? Nine people? Eleven people?

00:48:04.558 --> 00:48:06.245
Is that so important?

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:08.730
It is.

00:48:08.956 --> 00:48:11.206
Everything starts from the minor details.

00:48:11.495 --> 00:48:15.376
If you keep being vague like that, big problems will occur in the future.

00:48:16.597 --> 00:48:18.831
I really dislike vague things.

00:48:19.245 --> 00:48:21.567
Last time, you told me that all I had to do was

00:48:21.807 --> 00:48:23.816
be friendly to customers and not rip them off.

00:48:23.841 --> 00:48:25.193
Those were special rules.

00:48:25.218 --> 00:48:27.056
These are basic rules.

00:48:27.628 --> 00:48:30.272
Why? Do you have a problem with me asking you to be clear?

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:31.980
No.

00:48:32.394 --> 00:48:35.677
Starting from tomorrow, I'll write down exactly how many customers come.

00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:38.589
Good.

00:48:39.019 --> 00:48:40.019
Good luck then.

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.279
There are so many weird people in this world.

00:48:49.971 --> 00:48:51.526
What a weirdo.

00:48:55.081 --> 00:48:56.725
Gosh, these are so pretty, too.

00:48:59.019 --> 00:49:00.596
My hubby is perfect...

00:49:01.495 --> 00:49:03.425
but why doesn't he have any money?

00:49:07.417 --> 00:49:08.535
Is that my hubby?

00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:13.589
What's this?

00:49:17.277 --> 00:49:18.277
What?

00:49:23.167 --> 00:49:29.401
What? "Please come and congratulate the marriage of Jo Hee-dong and Park Shin-ae?"

00:49:35.425 --> 00:49:38.039
Hey, Jo Hee-dong, are you bored? What's this?

00:49:39.682 --> 00:49:40.682
What?

00:49:41.112 --> 00:49:42.112
It's real?

00:49:43.018 --> 00:49:45.843
You're not joking? You're really getting married?

00:49:49.011 --> 00:49:52.187
Mom! Mom, where are you? Mom!

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.429
Mom, how can you do this?

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:58.592
Mom, how can you let Hee-dong get married? Let me get married, too!

00:50:00.979 --> 00:50:06.932
Hee-ra. Hee-ra, your mom is very upset and sick right now, so-

00:50:06.957 --> 00:50:07.957
I don't care!

00:50:08.627 --> 00:50:10.484
I want to have a wedding, too!

00:50:11.511 --> 00:50:12.511
Divorce him.

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:15.289
Then I'll let you have a wedding.

00:50:16.667 --> 00:50:17.667
What?

00:50:18.401 --> 00:50:21.591
I'm asking you for a wedding, but you're telling me to get a divorce?

00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:23.721
Yes.

00:50:24.291 --> 00:50:29.620
If you get divorced, I'll get you married to an even better man...

00:50:30.604 --> 00:50:31.671
so get divorced.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:40.513
If I come to see you again, I'll be No Hee-ra instead of Jo Hee-ra.

00:50:41.331 --> 00:50:43.783
I'm not scared.

00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:48.243
You're not my daughter, so don't come here anymore.

00:50:48.495 --> 00:50:51.857
Goodness! You should have gone easy on her!

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:55.721
-Hee-ra! -Goodness. How can they both be like this?

00:50:56.932 --> 00:51:00.713
They're my enemies, not my kids.

00:51:10.682 --> 00:51:11.682
Goodness.

00:51:12.339 --> 00:51:15.815
Is that true? Your brother is getting married?

00:51:17.971 --> 00:51:22.517
Yes. They already got a wedding hall, and they're going to go on a honeymoon, too.

00:51:23.432 --> 00:51:26.268
It's going to happen next week.

00:51:27.128 --> 00:51:28.128
Is that true?

00:51:29.432 --> 00:51:30.432
Yes.

00:51:30.628 --> 00:51:35.085
They're only going to give Hee-dong a wedding and not me. How can they do this?

00:51:36.612 --> 00:51:38.844
My brother must be the only child they have.

00:51:39.315 --> 00:51:41.782
They must really have thrown me away.

00:51:44.823 --> 00:51:47.720
Come on. That can't be true, Hee-ra.

00:51:48.017 --> 00:51:51.733
Children aren't tissues you blow into and throw away.

00:51:52.432 --> 00:51:56.120
Your mom is just angry. I'm sure that's not the case.

00:51:56.307 --> 00:51:59.823
So stop crying, okay, Hee-ra? Okay, sweetie?

00:52:05.362 --> 00:52:06.362
Goodness.

00:52:09.823 --> 00:52:13.041
Should we go to the wedding or not?

00:52:13.557 --> 00:52:16.901
They're still our in-laws, so we must go.

00:52:17.714 --> 00:52:22.247
Regardless of what they think, we should still go congratulate them.

00:52:22.745 --> 00:52:24.620
That way, we'll feel more comfortable, too.

00:52:25.987 --> 00:52:28.831
They'll obviously treat us like leftover rice.

00:52:31.323 --> 00:52:34.141
Oh, my. You were just crying a moment ago. Where are you going now?

00:52:34.491 --> 00:52:37.908
To meet my dad. He called and said he wants to meet me.

00:52:38.049 --> 00:52:40.471
I think he's going to give us a wedding, too!

00:52:48.596 --> 00:52:54.385
I already forgave you in my heart.

00:52:55.917 --> 00:53:00.002
Then why aren't you giving me a wedding?

00:53:00.354 --> 00:53:01.946
You're only doing it for Hee-dong.

00:53:03.229 --> 00:53:05.604
While watching Hee-dong prepare for his wedding,

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:09.893
I thought a lot about you.

00:53:10.675 --> 00:53:11.675
I'm sorry.

00:53:13.213 --> 00:53:14.213
No.

00:53:15.464 --> 00:53:16.878
I'm sorry, dad.

00:53:18.268 --> 00:53:22.596
I hurt you and made you angry.

00:53:25.495 --> 00:53:28.595
Some time after Hee-dong's wedding, I'll persuade your mom

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.614
somehow, and we'll let you have a beautiful wedding, too.

00:53:32.362 --> 00:53:34.762
So don't be too upset and live well.

00:53:35.745 --> 00:53:37.360
That's why I wanted to meet you today.

00:53:38.744 --> 00:53:40.112
Dad!

00:53:41.307 --> 00:53:43.018
Dad!

00:53:44.534 --> 00:53:47.713
Yes, my daughter.

00:53:51.839 --> 00:53:56.416
But dad, is Hee-dong's wife pretty?

00:53:58.386 --> 00:53:59.986
She is. She's kind, too.

00:54:00.846 --> 00:54:04.908
But no matter how pretty and kind she is,

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:09.364
you can't love her more than you love me, or I'll really hate you then.

00:54:09.901 --> 00:54:13.776
No matter how much I love my daughter-in-law, I won't love her as much as I love you.

00:54:17.667 --> 00:54:20.409
But now that Hee-dong is getting married, don't

00:54:20.434 --> 00:54:23.346
call him informally in front of your sister-in-law.

00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:26.087
Depends on the way he acts.

00:54:28.167 --> 00:54:32.724
And no matter what your mom says, come by the house often.

00:54:32.749 --> 00:54:34.119
That way, she'll forgive you.

00:54:34.596 --> 00:54:35.908
All right.

00:54:37.011 --> 00:54:38.011
Little brat.

00:54:38.909 --> 00:54:39.909
Dad.

00:54:40.205 --> 00:54:42.424
Can you make me a credit card?

00:54:44.112 --> 00:54:45.112
Ask mom.

00:54:49.385 --> 00:54:53.785
No monetary gifts will be accepted. Just come and congratulate us.

00:54:54.159 --> 00:54:55.580
Congratulations, Mr. Jo.

00:54:55.605 --> 00:54:57.487
-Here you go. -Congratulations!

00:54:57.512 --> 00:55:02.450
Give me one, too! Goodness! He's finally getting married! Congratulations!

00:55:02.776 --> 00:55:03.776
Ms. Joo.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:09.950
I don't know who she is, but she's a very blessed one.

00:55:10.526 --> 00:55:13.659
She gets to have a nice father-in-law like you.

00:55:15.112 --> 00:55:17.494
I didnâ€™t know I would be so happy to get a daughter-in-law.

00:55:17.798 --> 00:55:20.549
Since my son likes her, so do I.

00:55:21.174 --> 00:55:24.861
I see. Congratulations.

00:55:25.463 --> 00:55:26.463
Thank you.

00:55:37.229 --> 00:55:39.296
Mom, you're watching me, right?

00:55:41.315 --> 00:55:43.715
I survived, just like I promised you I would.

00:55:45.034 --> 00:55:46.642
I'm getting married tomorrow.

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:50.147
He will be your son-in-law.

00:55:52.151 --> 00:55:55.181
He's a golden rope for me.

00:55:56.893 --> 00:56:00.510
I will never let go of this golden rope.

00:56:05.502 --> 00:56:11.093
Mom, from now on, I'm going to live a good life.

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:14.181
I'll live well for your sake, too.

00:56:21.987 --> 00:56:23.453
Shin-ae, what's wrong?

00:56:29.541 --> 00:56:31.016
I'm so happy.

00:56:33.479 --> 00:56:35.479
This feels like a happy dream.

00:57:40.792 --> 00:57:43.089
What kind of dream is this?

00:57:44.511 --> 00:57:48.800
Why does she have to appear in my dream before the wedding? Such bad luck!

00:57:52.746 --> 00:57:56.401
This was just a silly dream!

00:58:14.886 --> 00:58:15.953
Congratulations.

00:58:16.925 --> 00:58:18.275
-Congratulations. -Thank you.

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:21.151
-Thank you. -Thank you.

00:58:22.206 --> 00:58:23.878
Chung-ja!

00:58:24.894 --> 00:58:29.292
-I heard your daughter-in-law is beautiful! -You're so lucky!

00:58:33.847 --> 00:58:35.252
What's wrong?

00:58:35.277 --> 00:58:36.628
Let's hurry up and go in.

00:58:44.628 --> 00:58:45.628
Over there!

00:58:45.653 --> 00:58:48.071
Grandmother and mother, they're over there.

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.386
Grandmother and mother, this is my dad.

00:58:57.411 --> 00:58:59.365
-Hello. -Congratulations.

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:00.390
Thank you.

00:59:07.014 --> 00:59:09.070
Hee-dong, congratulations on your marriage!

00:59:09.381 --> 00:59:10.581
Thanks for coming.

00:59:19.998 --> 00:59:20.998
Is that true?

00:59:21.023 --> 00:59:25.669
Yes! I heard that Chung-ja was so hard on her daughter-in-law for being an orphan!

00:59:25.694 --> 00:59:28.580
I can just imagine that. I feel so bad.

00:59:29.115 --> 00:59:34.168
I don't know who her parents were, but they must be so heartbroken in heaven.

00:59:34.193 --> 00:59:37.998
I know. They're going to get married anyways, so she might as well be nice about it.

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.560
I know.

00:59:42.467 --> 00:59:45.054
But is that old man Chung-ja's elder?

00:59:45.404 --> 00:59:47.818
He must be the one with the 100 million dollar inheritance.

00:59:47.843 --> 00:59:51.802
Oh my gosh. He's so vigorous, and he has a sturdy appearance as well.

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:58.059
If I was only ten years younger, I would've flirted with him.

00:59:58.342 --> 00:59:59.342
Mother!

01:00:00.373 --> 01:00:04.911
But he looks so healthy. He'll live to be over a hundred years old.

01:00:05.998 --> 01:00:10.870
Poor Chung-ja. She hates that "100-Year-Life" song so much.

01:00:11.303 --> 01:00:12.303
Goodness!

01:00:13.115 --> 01:00:16.560
What's the use of getting that money when you're old? What will you do with it?

01:00:43.209 --> 01:00:46.427
Shin-ae, this is my younger sister Jo Hee-ra.

01:00:47.209 --> 01:00:49.184
And this is her husband Lee Jang-soo.

01:00:50.131 --> 01:00:51.131
Hello.

01:00:51.779 --> 01:00:52.912
Hello.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.865
Yes. Hello.

01:00:56.756 --> 01:00:58.689
Your wedding dress is pretty.

01:01:03.443 --> 01:01:05.443
Okay, shall we take a picture?

01:01:06.748 --> 01:01:09.307
All right. Let's take a picture.

01:01:10.506 --> 01:01:11.506
Smile! One-

01:01:13.935 --> 01:01:15.684
One, two, three!

01:01:19.302 --> 01:01:20.935
One, two, three!

01:01:21.225 --> 01:01:23.900
-The groom has to get ready. -Hee-dong, hurry up and go!

01:01:24.842 --> 01:01:26.882
-See you in a bit. -See you later.

01:01:29.209 --> 01:01:30.723
Congratulations.

01:01:54.973 --> 01:02:01.340
We shall commence the wedding of Jo Hee-dong and Park Shin-ae.

01:02:05.467 --> 01:02:07.467
Groom and bride, please enter.

01:02:20.193 --> 01:02:21.193
You look cool!

01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:34.658
Mom, you're watching me right now, aren't you?

01:03:42.889 --> 01:03:44.350
(Blow Breeze)

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.191
Groom and bride, please enter.

01:03:48.365 --> 01:03:51.595
You ungrateful beast!

01:03:53.818 --> 01:03:54.888
I'm sorry, Seung-hee!

01:03:54.913 --> 01:03:56.256
I'll never forgive you.

01:03:56.281 --> 01:03:58.607
Do you promise to love me forever?
